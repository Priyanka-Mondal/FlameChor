     Could not deduce: (C ('KConf p) ≽ C ('KConf ('KConj p q)),
                         I ('KConf ('KConj p q)) ≽ I ('KConf p))
        arising from a use of ‘assertFlowsTo’
     In the expression: assertFlowsTo ((p *∧ q) *→) (p *→)
      In an equation for ‘flTConfConjL’:
          flTConfConjL p q = assertFlowsTo ((p *∧ q) *→) (p *→)
