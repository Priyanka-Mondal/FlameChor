    Could not deduce: (C p ≽ C ('KConj ('KConf p) ('KInteg 'KBot)),
                        I ('KConj ('KConf p) ('KInteg 'KBot)) ≽ I p)
       arising from a use of ‘assertFlowsTo’
    In the expression: assertFlowsTo ((p *→) *∧ (SBot *←)) p
     In an equation for ‘neg_flTConf’:
         neg_flTConf p = assertFlowsTo ((p *→) *∧ (SBot *←)) p
