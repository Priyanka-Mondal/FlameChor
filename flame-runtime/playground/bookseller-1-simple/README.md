# Simple bookseller

The bookseller protocol defines an interaction between two participants: a
seller and a (would-be) buyer.  The protocol begins with the buyer sending the
title of a book they want to buy to the seller.  The seller replies with the
bookâ€™s price, and the buyer checks if the price is within their budget.  If the
buyer can afford the book, they inform the seller and get back a delivery date;
otherwise, they tell the seller they will not buy the book.

In this example, we assume the only books that a buyer can buy are `Types and
Programming Languages` and `Homotopy Type Theory` as `priceOf` and `deliveryOf`
are partial functions:

```haskell
priceOf :: String -> Int
priceOf "Types and Programming Languages" = 80
priceOf "Homotopy Type Theory"            = 120

deliveryDateOf :: String -> Day
deliveryDateOf "Types and Programming Languages" = fromGregorian 2022 12 19
deliveryDateOf "Homotopy Type Theory"            = fromGregorian 2023 01 01
```

It's straightforward to extend these definitions and make them total.

## Running the example

```bash
# in shell 1
cabal run bookseller-1-simple buyer

# in shell 2
cabal run bookseller-1-simple seller

# shell 1 will prompt the user to type in the book they want to buy
> Enter the title of the book to buy
Types and Programming Languages

# shell 1 will return the delivery date it receives from the seller or out of budget
# then both programs terminate
> The book will be delivered on 2022-12-19


# if we run the choreography again with a different book to buy

# in shell 1
cabal run bookseller-1-simple buyer

# in shell 2
cabal run bookseller-1-simple seller

# in shell 1
> Enter the title of the book to buy
Homotopy Type Theory

# in shell 1
> The book's price is out of the budget
```
