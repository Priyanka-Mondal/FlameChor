1. Complete context normalization:
	- for each conjunction on the LHS, add a pseudo-node to the graph that is
		reachable from each conjunct and from which the intersection of the
		superiors of each conjunct are reachable.
	- for each disjunction on the RHS, add a pseudo-node to the graph that is
		reaches each disjunction and is reachable from the intersection of 
		the inferiors of each disjunct.
	- fixed points?
2. implement (local) dynamic principal comparison algorithm.

3. implement FLA wrappers for caveats (Prin pc, Prin l, caveat).
	- satisfy_exact(Bound l, Lbl l caveat)
	- satisfy_general((Bound pc, Bound l, caveat) -> IFC pc l Bool)
